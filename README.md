# Title : Box-Office-Breakdown

In this project, we have worked on analysis of a dataset https://www.kaggle.com which is based on 40k+ movies.

## Factors we have analysed :

- Movie & year wise distribution  (DONE)
- What is the average rating of movies by genre?
- Director with most popular movies along with year
- Actors with most popular movies along with year
- Most Popular movies based on votes, critics and total votes , duration (Creating a formula for this)
- Most popular movies in each genre.
- Analysing movieâ€™s popularity on factors like actor , director, duration, year, genre, country, etc. (Identifying the reason for a movie that why it is popular)
- Linear graph on the total movies released in each year.



Here are some additional questions you could explore with the given dataset:

Which country produces the longest and shortest movies on average?
Is there a relationship between the duration of a movie and its rating?
How do the different aspects (humor, rhythm, effort, tension, erotism) contribute to the overall rating of a movie?
Which actor/director has been involved in the most movies in the dataset?
Is there a difference in the rating of movies based on their genre?
To perform statistical analysis on these questions, you could consider the following:

To test if there is a significant difference in the average duration of movies produced in different countries, you could use a one-way ANOVA test.
To test if there is a correlation between the duration and rating of movies, you could use the Pearson correlation coefficient.
To test the contribution of the different aspects to the overall rating of a movie, you could use a multiple linear regression model.
To identify the actor/director involved in the most movies in the dataset, you could use the value_counts() method and visualize the data using a bar chart.
To test if there is a significant difference in the rating of movies based on their genre, you could use a one-way ANOVA test.

What is the distribution of the average vote for movies in the dataset? Use a histogram to visualize the distribution and calculate the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution.
Is there a significant difference in the public vote for movies with different genres? Use a box plot to visualize the data and perform a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the distributions.
How does the number of total votes for a movie affect its rating? Use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship and calculate the correlation coefficient.
How does the rating of movies change over time? Use a line chart to visualize the trend and perform a linear regression to estimate the rate of change.
Are there any outliers in the duration of movies in the dataset? Use a box plot to visualize the distribution and calculate the interquartile range and identify any outliers.
